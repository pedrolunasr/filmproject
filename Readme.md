This is a project where you can add a movie and its information to a list and consult that list later. The project consists of four files: 'cadastro.c' contains the functions used in the project, 'cadastro.h' is the header file used in 'main.c' to access those functions, 'main.c' is where the functions are implemented and used, and finally, there is the 'make' file responsible for compiling and running the code.
